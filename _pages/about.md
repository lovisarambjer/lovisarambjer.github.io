**Welcome to my website!** 

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Uppsala Univeristy, studying the impact of AI and algorithmic decision making in the labor market. During the spring 2025 I am visiting Boston University and CREST Paris.

I will be on the 2025/2026 job market.

In my job market paper I study the use of an algorithmic prediction of jobseekers' reemployment probability at the Swedish Public Employment Service, designed to target job search assistance to those with the greatest needs. I study the implications of caseworker deviations from the algorithmic recommendation in terms of predictive performance. Leveraging institutional features and a shift in the algorithmic regime, I analyze the determinants of successful caseworker-algorithm collaboration.
