**Welcome to my website!** 

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Uppsala Univeristy, with a special interest in the impact of AI and algorithmic decision making in the labor market. I am affiliated with the
WASP-HS research cluster on AI, Structural Change, and the Future of Work.

During the spring 2025 I was visiting Boston University and CREST Paris.

I will be on the 2025/2026 job market.

**Prediction versus Discretion:** 
**Human-Algorithm Collaboration in Assignment of Unemployed Jobseekers [JMP]**
<span style="font-size: 0.8em"> Can caseworkers improve upon algorithmic assignment of unemployed jobseekers to active labor market programs (ALMPs) at the Public Employment Service (PES)? This paper examines the impact of caseworker discretion over an algorithm that recommends assignments based on predicted unemployment risk. I develop a framework in which ALMP assignment involves a trade-off between a needs-based allocation - prioritizing jobseekers at highest unemployment risk—and an efficient allocation that maximizes treatment effects. Consequently, even a perfectly predictive algorithm may fail to maximize welfare, creating scope for caseworker discretion to add value beyond improving prediction. Leveraging as-if random assignment of jobseekers to caseworkers, I reconstruct the algorithmic counterfactual and estimate the impact of caseworker deviations from the algorithmic recommendation. The results show that caseworkers reduce alignment with both needs-based and efficient allocations relative to strict adherence to the algorithm. Finally, I document substantial algorithmic bias in favor of immigrants, who are disproportionately recommended ALMPs relative to their group-level reemployment potential. Caseworkers mitigate this bias by assigning more natives to ALMPs, yet this adjustment comes at a cost: employment outcomes for natives decline, while those for immigrants remain unchanged.</span>

**Strictness in the evaluation of job search effort and employment outcomes**
<span style="font-size: 0.8em">  Joint with Johan Vikström, IFAU, and Arne Uhlendorff, CREST.  

<span style="font-size: 0.8em">  Unemployed job seekers must comply with job-search requirements to be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. We exploit exogenous variation in strictness across caseworkers who conduct monthly reviews of these requirements to examine the effects of stricter enforcement on job finding, search intensity, and job quality. Stricter caseworkers increase the likelihood of reported violations and benefit sanctions. This leads to persistently higher job-search intensity, shorter unemployment durations and higher employment rates. These positive employment effects are more pronounced under less favorable local labor market conditions and longer lasting for job seekers with weak labor market attachment
